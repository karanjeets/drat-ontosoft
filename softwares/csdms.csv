"TopoFlow-Meteorology","This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model.","https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow"
"Terrapin","Terrapin (or TerraPIN) stands for "Terraces put into Numerics". It is a module that generates the expected terraces, both strath and fill, from prescribed river aggradation and degradation.","https://github.com/awickert/terrapin"
"STSWM","The model is related to the numerical solution of the shallow water equations in spherical geometry. The shallow water equations are used as a kernel for both oceanic and atmospheric general circulation models and are of interest in evaluating numerical methods for weather forecasting and climate...","http://www.csm.ornl.gov/chammp/stswm/index.html"
"GOLEM","Landscape evolution model. Computes evolution of topography under the action of rainfall and tectonics.","https://github.com/csdms-contrib/golem"

"Acronym1D","Acronym1D is an add on to Acronym1R in that it adds a flow duration curve to Acronym1R, which computes the volume bedload transport rate per unit width and bedload grain size distribution from a specified surface grain size distribution (with sand removed).","https://github.com/csdms-contrib/stm"
